# Advent of Code 2023


It seems like there's a snow production issue, and I've been chosen to assist the Elves in resolving it. As the appointed troubleshooter, I've been handed a map adorned with stars, marking the top fifty locations suspected to have snow production problems.

In this repository, you'll discover my solutions to the daily puzzles presented in the Advent calendar. With two puzzles each day, successfully solving them grants me stars, essential for restoring snow operations by December 25th.
